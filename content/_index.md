I am an Assistant Professor of [Research and Evaluation Methodology Program](https://education.ufl.edu/research-evaluation-methods/) in the School of Human Development and Organizational Studies in Education within the College of Education at the University of Florida.

My research focuses on applications of **theory-based Natural Language Processing** and **Learning Analytics**.
My primary research interest is investigating how to **bridge the gap between psychometric and artificial intelligence in education research**. 

I have experience with various industry projects with international partners, such as the Medical Council of Canada, American College Testing, and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority,

Apart form academe, I enjoy doing yoga, figure skating, traveling, and anything outdoorsy (you name it!  :lotus_position: :ice_skate: :earth_americas: :camping:).
